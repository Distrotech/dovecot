## Authentication processes
##

# You can have multiple processes; each time "auth = xx" is seen, a new
# process definition is started. The point of multiple processes is to be
# able to set stricter permissions to others. For example, plain/PAM
# authentication requires roots, but if you also use digest-md5 authentication
# for some users, you can authenticate them without any privileges in a
# separate auth process. Just remember that only one auth process is asked
# for the password, so you can't have different passwords with different
# processes (unless they have different auth methods, and you're ok with
# having different password for each method).

# Authentication process name.
auth = default

# Authentication methods this process allows separated with a space
auth_methods = plain

# Space separated list of realms with authentication methods that need them.
# This is usually empty or the host name of the server (eg.
# mail.mycompany.com).
#  - plain auth checks the password from all realms specified in here
#  - digest-md5 must have the password added for each realm separately, and
#    many clients simply use the first realm listed here. so if you really
#    need to add more realms, add them to end of the list.
