# Default MAIL environment to use when it's not set. By leaving this empty
# dovecot tries to do some automatic detection as described in
# doc/mail-storages.txt. There's a few special variables you can use:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if user there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# You can also limit a width of string by giving the number of max. characters
# after the '%' character. For example %1u gives the first character of
# username. Some examples:
#
#   maildir:/var/mail/%1u/%u/Maildir
#   mbox:~/mail/:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mbox:/var/mail/%d/%n/:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%n

#default_mail_env = 

# Space-separated list of fields to cache for all mails. Currently these
# fields are allowed followed by a list of commands they speed up:
#
#  Envelope      - FETCH ENVELOPE and SEARCH FROM, TO, CC, BCC, SUBJECT,
#                  SENTBEFORE, SENTON, SENTSINCE, HEADER MESSAGE-ID,
#                  HEADER IN-REPLY-TO
#  Body          - FETCH BODY
#  Bodystructure - FETCH BODY, BODYSTRUCTURE
#  MessagePart   - FETCH BODY[1.2.3] (ie. body parts), RFC822.SIZE,
#                  SEARCH SMALLER, LARGER, also speeds up BODY/BODYSTRUCTURE
#                  generation. This is always set with mbox mailboxes, and
#                  also default with Maildir.
#
# Different IMAP clients work in different ways, that's why Dovecot by default
# only caches MessagePart which speeds up most operations. Whenever client
# does something where caching could be used, the field is automatically marked
# to be cached later. For example after FETCH BODY the BODY will be cached
# for all new messages. Normally you should leave this alone, unless you know
# what most of your IMAP clients are. Caching more fields than needed makes
# the index files larger and generate useless I/O.
#
# With maildir there's one extra optimization - if nothing is cached, indexing
# the maildir becomes much faster since it's not opening any of the mail files.
# This could be useful if your IMAP clients access only new mails.

#     Never send EXISTS/RECENT when replying to FETCH command. Outlook Express

#     in server" error. Note that OE6 still breaks even with this workaround
#     if synchronization is set to "Headers Only".

# Dovecot can notify client of new mail in selected mailbox soon after it's

# Use mmap() instead of read() to read mail files. read() seems to be a bit

# Copy mail to another folders using hard links. This is much faster than
# actually copying the file. This is problematic only if something modifies

# requires that the mails don't change, so it would be problematic in any case.

#maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = no

# Which locking methods to use for locking mbox. There's three available:
#  dotlock: Create <mailbox>.lock file. This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
#           solution. If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users
#           will need write access to that directory.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use both fcntl and flock too; if you do the order they're declared
# with is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using both fcntl
# and flock. If dotlock is used, it's always created first.
#mbox_locks = dotlock fcntl

# Should we create dotlock file even when we want only a read-lock? Setting

## Authentication processes

# You can have multiple processes; each time "auth = xx" is seen, a new

# authentication requires roots, but if you also use digest-md5 authentication
# for some users, you can authenticate them without any privileges in a
# separate auth process. Just remember that only one auth process is asked
# for the password, so you can't have different passwords with different
# processes (unless they have different auth methods, and you're ok with
# having different password for each method).
