# WARNING: Never add directories here which local users can modify, that
# may lead to root exploit. Usually this should be done only if you don't
# allow shell access for users.
#valid_chroot_dirs = 

# Space-separated list of fields to cache for all mails. Currently these
# fields are allowed followed by a list of commands they speed up:
#
#  Envelope      - FETCH ENVELOPE and SEARCH FROM, TO, CC, BCC, SUBJECT,
#                  SENTBEFORE, SENTON, SENTSINCE, HEADER MESSAGE-ID,
#                  HEADER IN-REPLY-TO
#  Body          - FETCH BODY
#  Bodystructure - FETCH BODY, BODYSTRUCTURE
#  MessagePart   - FETCH BODY[1.2.3] (ie. body parts), RFC822.SIZE,
#                  SEARCH SMALLER, LARGER, also speeds up BODY/BODYSTRUCTURE
#                  generation. This is always set with mbox mailboxes, and
#                  also default with Maildir.
#
# Different IMAP clients work in different ways, that's why Dovecot by default
# only caches MessagePart which speeds up most operations. Whenever client
# does something where caching could be used, the field is automatically marked
# to be cached later. For example after FETCH BODY the BODY will be cached
# for all new messages. Normally you should leave this alone, unless you know
# what most of your IMAP clients are. Caching more fields than needed makes
# the index files larger and generate useless I/O.
#
# With maildir there's one extra optimization - if nothing is cached, indexing
# the maildir becomes much faster since it's not opening any of the mail files.
# This could be useful if your IMAP clients access only new mails.

# Space-separated list of fields that Dovecot should never set to be cached.
# Useful if you want to save disk space at the cost of more I/O when the fields
# needed.

# Save mails with CR+LF instead of plain LF. This makes sending those mails
# take less CPU, especially with sendfile() syscall with Linux and FreeBSD.
# But it also creates a bit more disk I/O which may just make it slower.
#mail_save_crlf = no

# Copy mail to another folders using hard links. This is much faster than
# actually copying the file. Only problem with it is that if either of the
# mails are modified directly both will change. This isn't a problem with
# IMAP however since it offers no way to modify the existing mails. Also
# at least mutt modifies mails by deleting the old one and inserting a new
# modified mail. So if performance matters at all you should turn this on.
#maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = no

# Check if mails' content has been changed by external programs. This slows
# down things as extra stat() needs to be called for each file.
#maildir_check_content_changes = no

# If main index file is incompatible with us, should we overwrite it or
# create a new index with another name. Unless you are running Dovecot in
# multiple computers with different architectures accessing the same

## Authentication processes
##

# You can have multiple processes; each time "auth = xx" is seen, a new
# process definition is started. The point of multiple processes is to be
# able to set stricter permissions to others. For example, plain/PAM
# authentication requires roots, but if you also use digest-md5 authentication
# for some users, you can authenticate them without any privileges in a
# separate auth process. Just remember that only one auth process is asked
# for the password, so you can't have different passwords with different
# processes (unless they have different auth methods, and you're ok with
# having different password for each method).

# Authentication process name.

# Authentication methods this process allows separated with a space.
# Currently supported: plain digest-md5

# Space separated list of realms with authentication methods that need them.
# This is usually empty or the host name of the server (eg.
# mail.mycompany.com).
#  - plain auth checks the password from all realms specified in here
#  - digest-md5 must have the password added for each realm separately, and
#    many clients simply use the first realm listed here. so if you really
#    need to add more realms, add them to end of the list.

# digest-md5 authentication process. It requires special MD5 passwords which

# privileges, so it may be 0600-root owned file.
